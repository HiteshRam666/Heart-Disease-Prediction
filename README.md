# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction

Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction project! This repository contains code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict heart disease.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing, model training, and making predictions.

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
    cd heart-disease-prediction
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb
    ```

2. Run all the cells to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions.

## üìä Data

The dataset used in this project typically contains the following columns:
- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Sex of the patient
- `cp`: Chest pain type
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Exercise induced angina
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- `ca`: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- `thal`: Thalassemia
- `target`: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = presence, 0 = absence)

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Building**: Train various machine learning models to predict heart disease.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics to ensure high accuracy.

## üìà Results

The model predicts the presence of heart disease with high accuracy using machine learning techniques.

Stay heart-healthy! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®
